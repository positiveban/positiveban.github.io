__Abstract__
Abstractâ€”This study addresses an optimal power flow problem for microgrids regarding faulty generators. Based on the recent developments of online diagnosis methods of an inter-turn short circuit fault, an estimated fault severity factor is related to the output power degradation of a generator. In the sequel, an optimal power flow problem is newly defined by using the severity factors and degraded outputs of each distributed generators in a faulty-generator scenario. The simulation result shows the effectiveness of the proposed strategy for reducing the optimal cost in the faulty scenario compared to the optimal power flow problem disregarding generator faults.
