__Abstract__
In this paper, we developed a complex projective synchronization for complex chaotic systems. We generalized
a complex scaling matrix for synchronizing two chaotic systems with different orders. We proposed an adaptive control
method to synchronize between drive and response chaotic complex systems with fully unknown parameters. Based on
Lyapunov theorem, we proved the stability of the synchronization. Numerical simulations are given to verify the proposed
method.
