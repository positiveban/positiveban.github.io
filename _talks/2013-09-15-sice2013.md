__Abstract__
In this paper, nonlinear disturbance observer based terminal sliding mode synchronization for two different chaotic systems is proposed. It is assumed that the response system has unknown bounded uncertainties and disturbances. To solve this problem, adaptive law is used in sliding mode controller to adjust unknown bound of them. In order to reduce chattering phenomenon of sliding mode control, nonlinear disturbance observer is adopted and adaptive scheme makes the chattering decrease with respect to disturbance error. Terminal sliding mode guarantees that synchronous error converges to zero in finite time. It is proved by using Lyapunov stability theorem. Some numerical examples are presented to validate the effectiveness of proposed method.
