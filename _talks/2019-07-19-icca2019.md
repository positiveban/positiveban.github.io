__Abstract__
In this study, we propose a design method of a reset controller for the class of single-input and single-output (SISO) linear systems. The design method is formulated by linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), it is easily incorporated with useful performance criteria such as $\mathcal{H}_2$ or $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$ norm. The design method is available even for higher-order systems with guaranteeing stability, which has not been available for the existing literature.
