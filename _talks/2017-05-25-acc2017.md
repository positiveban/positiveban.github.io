__Abstract__
This paper presents stability and L2-gain analysis of impulsive switched systems. In this work, not only are continuous disturbances on the systems considered, but also discrete disturbances at impulse instants by introducing a weighted mixed L2/l2-gain. Sufficient conditions that guarantee stability and an upper bound of the L2-gain are given in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Based on the sufficient conditions, a hybrid controller design methodology is provided. A numerical example is provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.
