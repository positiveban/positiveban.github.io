__Abstract__
This paper proposed a robust H-infinity fault estimation method and a fault-tolerant control(FTC) of vapor compression cycle(VCC) systems. Based on a moving boundary model(MBM), linearization and model reduction were conducted. Actuator faults were estimated by a proportional-integral(PI)-observer and it was designed using a H-infinity estimation theory. Robust fault-tolerant controller was designed using a convex optimazation and input constraints of VCC system were considered. Simulation result was presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.
